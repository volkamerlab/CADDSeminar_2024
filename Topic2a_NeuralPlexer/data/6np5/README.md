* `protein.pdb`, and `ligand.sdf` contain the original (cocrystallized) protein and ligand respectivly. Both files where obtained from (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10373581)[https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10373581].
* `protein_zero_coordinates.pdb` contains the Kanamycin B protein with all atom coordinates set to zero, files was generated by [NeuralPLexer](https://github.com/zrqiao/NeuralPLexer).
* `ligand_zero_coordinates.sdf` contains ligand 9CS with all atom coordinates set to zero, files was generated using [RDKit](https://www.rdkit.org/) functionality.
